üí°Reflections
This  highlights the learning attained, challenges faced, and lessons learnt throughout the tenure of this course.


üí°Assignment 1 (ASG1)

üí°One key realization is that paper qualifications alone are not enough; having the right skills for the job is what truly matters. With the rapid advancements in AI, it's essential to understand the fundamental logic behind large language models (LLMs). This knowledge helps us determine when and how to use them effectively.

The field of IT evolves at an incredibly fast pace, and staying prepared requires adopting a mindset of lifelong learning. By the time we graduate after four years, the IT landscape will have shifted significantly compared to when the curriculum was designed. This underscores the importance of being passionate and proactive in learning new technologies starting today.

üí° Suggestions for Improvement
To enhance the learning experience, I suggest incorporating live sessions with speakers instead of relying solely on recorded versions. Additionally, inviting seasoned professionals, such as a CTO, to share their insights on the IT industry in Malaysia would be valuable. Listening to their entrepreneurial journeys and real-world experiences could provide a deeper understanding of the current IT landscape and inspire students to prepare for future challenges.
